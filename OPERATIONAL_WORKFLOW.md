# v1 Operational Workflow: The WhatsApp Dashboard

Until the backend dashboard is activated, the business will "run on WhatsApp." This SOP ensures professional and consistent service.

## 1. The Order Cycle

### Step A: Reception
1. Customer sends the structured message from the website.
2. **Staff Action:** Reply with a standard greeting immediately.
   > *"Hello! Mai Inji kitchen here. We've received your order request. One moment while we confirm the grill's capacity! ⏳"*

### Step B: Confirmation & Settlement
1. Staff verifies item availability.
2. **Staff Action:** Send the confirmation message + total + payment instructions.
   > *"Order Verified! Total including delivery to [Address] is ₦[Total]. We are starting your prep now! You can pay via cash on delivery or transfer to [Bank Details]."*

### Step C: Fulfillment
1. Kitchen prepares the order.
2. Order is handed to the rider.
3. **Staff Action:** Send a "Moving" update.
   > *"Your flavor is on the move! Our rider is [Name] - [Phone Number]. See you soon! 🛵"*

## 2. Internal Record Keeping (The "Manual Backend")

**Important:** To build the analytics we need for Phase Gates, staff must record every 24 hours:
- Total Orders Received
- Total Revenue Generated
- Most Popular Item of the Day
- Any complaints or canceled orders

*Suggestion: Keep a simple Google Sheet or physical logbook linked to the WhatsApp business line.*

## 3. WhatsApp Business Features to Use
- **Quick Replies:** Save the messages above as shortcuts (e.g., `/greet`, `/confirm`).
- **Labels:** Use WhatsApp Labels to track order stages:
  - `New Order` (Blue)
  - `Prep / Cooking` (Yellow)
  - `Out for Delivery` (Purple)
  - `Completed / Paid` (Green)
